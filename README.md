# Arduino_RearViewCensor
Arduino Project using censors to create a cars rearview system
The project is designed based off of a cars rearview censor system. Using an ultrasonic sensor we designed a system that depending on the distance detected, we have four LED's that go off, one green, two yellow, and one red.  
With the three distance markers, we also have an LCD screen running three different indications to tell the user where they are with respect to whatever is getting closer/getting closer to it.
